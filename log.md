**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finally committed to challenge, despite doing bits and bobs of coding over the last few months. Worked on 3 hackerrank challenges and tidied up a bit of my event page.

**Thoughts**: Happy to finally commit

### Day 2: January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Never played with Next.js so figured today was the day. Worked through the BASICS section on their site and deployed through now.

**Thoughts**: Took about 90mins and have a better understanding of what it is now.

## Day 3: Thursday January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started converting my current html + css portfolio website to Next.js. Spent most getting api to work.

**Thoughts**: Trying to lean in to dynamic rendering and avoid hard coding all content in my codebase. V daunting for me at least.

## Day 4: Saturday January 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Was feeling a bit lost with the Next.js portfolio so worked through the remainder of the freeCodeCamp curriculum so I would be 'up to' the final projects for Responsive Web Development and could work on those.

**Thoughts**: Feel like going through freeCodeCamp activities is cheating for some reason. I think as long as I don't ONLY do this it should be okay. Just don't want to keep falling back to HTML/CSS work when I the JS stuff gets difficult.

## Day 5: Sunday January 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed a bare-bones tribute site to Seymour Papert for the first Responsive Web Design project.

**Thoughts**: Wasn't very motivated to put much polish on the site. Hopefully at some point I can go back and finish it off.
