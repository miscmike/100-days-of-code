**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Never played with Next.js so figured today was the day. Worked through the BASICS section on their site and deployed through now.

**Thoughts**: Took about 90mins and have a better understanding of what it is now.

## Day 3: January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started converting my current html + css portfolio website to Next.js. Spent most getting api to work so I can display list of "work" oor "posts" I've done.

**Thoughts**: Trying to lean in to dynamic rendering and avoid hard coding all content in my codebase. V daunting for me at least.
